									<h4>Unit 2</h4>
									
									<h5>Internet of Things (IoT)</h5>
									
									<p>Internet of things has emerged as a revolutionary concept which may enable the opportunity to transform multiple industries which eventually enable multiple devices to collect data and more importantly exchange data. 

Huxley et al (2020) discusses about the data wrangling processes such as data extraction, cleaning, formatting and preparation for analysis.  In an era where the Internet of Things concept has gained widespread acceptance, it automatically implies an increase in data volumes necessitating scraping, extraction, cleansing, and comprehensive analysis. Opportunities of IoT is the efficiency and convenience, devices have the ability to enhance the convenience in many sectors including but not limited to smart homes to healthcare systems. It will enable the to gain data driven insights and foster the innovation. Yet that brings limitations as well such as security concerns. Due to its nature most of the IoT devices are vulnerable to cyber attacks and this may lead to data breaches, which also raises the issue of privacy for its users. Another challenge can be standardization as different manufacturers often use different protocols. Combining all these may lead to scalability issues about the data volumes and managing data and processing data can become a significant challenge.</p>

									<h4>Unit 4</h4>
									<p>In this unit, the focus was on the Data cleaning. Data cleaning is an essential pre-processing step in data analysis. Data management pipeline has 6 mains steps;
<ul>

  <li>Capturing raw data  </li>
  <li>Data cleaning </li>
  <li>Data integration </li>
  <li>Database design </li>
  <li>Data analysis </li>
  <li>Data presentation/visualization</li></ul>
The steps begins with capturing the raw data yet as raw data often comes with imperfections, inaccuracies or inconsistencies, cleaning the data become inevitable. Later on all the data gathered must be converted into a unified view, harmonized into one. This integrated data is then structured through effective database design, organizing it in a way that facilitates efficient retrieval and analysis. The heart of the process lies in data analysis, where sophisticated techniques and algorithms are applied to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends within the data. Finally the insights derived from the analysis are presented visually in an understandable narrative. </p>

									<p>
Here is our group project report for our first assignment. 


							<p>Development Team Project: Project Report – Database Design </p>

<p>Richard Charnock, Birkan Durak and Lucy Ringwood </p>

<h4>Objective</h4>
<p>A UK rail company has commissioned a new database system to track contact from customers through to resolution and allow data analysis to help identify areas requiring service improvement. It is intended to record contact from various communication methods including direct customer input into the company’s website will require validation and cleaning. Open-source data feeds from National Rail should be integrated to aid reliable categorization of the data. The system is expected to replace and incorporate a spreadsheet currently used to log contact.
<h4>Logical Design</h4> 
A database solution will collect data and store it in a highly structured format, making it accessible for users managing cases or searching the system, aiding data retrieval for analysis (Bookshear & Brylow, 2020). The database is intended to collect data on public contact flowing into the organisation and store an end-to-end view of the type and subject; organisational ownership of contact; and outcomes/ resolutions of the contact.
The system will hold data in a structured format but the inputs into the system come from multiple sources in different formats. Data directly from National Rail regarding train services and stations is available in semi-structured machine-readable XML format. The legacy customer service data is held in an XLSX, a highly human-readable format that is not easily read by database applications and requires processing before being usable. The data from other internal organisational datasets, such as HR systems, is retrievable in CSV format and considered semi-structured because it does not have the same level of organisation as a database system (EMCS 2015; Olhurst 2012)
The system is intended to follow best practice normal form rules of database design. This involves storing data in related groups per table to avoid duplicating rows within tables and repeating data across the system. The approach improves data consistency; avoids storing redundant data; and minimises insertion, deletion and modification errors as changes are made in one location (Harrington, 2009). The tables in the database each contain IDs, which operate as primary keys allowing association with related tables to join data across the system (Kazil & Jurmul, 2016). 
</p>
									
<p>The system will hold various data types within each table. IDs will be unique integer numbers. Varchar fields can hold strings of characters of various lengths, this will allow direct text entries as well as descriptive strings relating to data values to make them human-readable. Date Time fields record when key events occurred. (Harrington, 2009).								
</p>
									
<h4>Data management Pipeline</h4>
<p>Creating a robust data management pipeline is crucial precise handling of customer interactions and upholding customer satisfaction levels.
At the data-capturing stage, a Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface (REST API) can be used to access data from the National Rail public data feed. Data retrieval will be executed in Python, utilising the “requests” library to initiate an HTTP POST and GET requests to access required data. This data is saved in XML format for cleaning and processing (Wiki.openraildata.com, 2023). As National Rail's data feed is a trusted source, data is expected to be standardised and inherently reliable in terms of structural integrity. Additional sources to be integrated into the database, such as customer-initiated input and legacy data from spreadsheets, are likely to be unstructured and varied in data types.
An initial step in the data-cleaning phase is to transform the data into a format suitable for database insertion. After identifying headers to establish a foundational structure, the “ElementTree” library can be used to parse the data. A loop can be used to leverage these headers to segregate the data, facilitating creation of a list of dictionaries to create a Pandas dataframe (Pandey, 2021). This step also aids in implementing data-mapping techniques, ensuring accurate matching between primary and foreign keys, particularly when merging tables from diverse and formats – XML, XLSX, CSV. 
Regarding anomalies, null values are most likely to be frequently encountered. While transforming XML data, the loop can also be used to replace blank values with a designated placeholder—typically "none"—to signify absence of content.
Another critical process is standardisation of dates/ times. For this purpose, the Python “datetime” library can be implemented (Kazil and Jarmul, 2016). All datetime data should be converted into the same format, e.g. ISO 8601 (PyNative, 2022). Standardising timestamps is vital for maintaining data integrity, ensuring subsequent analyses are accurate, thereby guiding decision-making more effectively.
</p>

<h4>Database Build</h4>
<p>In the landscape of a data-driven world, designing and implementing an efficient database system is vital. The database model should address the challenges such as storage, user access and data manipulation, therefore our goal is to produce a scalable and well-structured database model which can serve the organization’s needs. The mission statement for the database is to monitor complaints originating from different channels which will allow the company to enhance its services and acquire valuable insights.</p>									
									
<p>View integration approach can be used to manage multiple user views, acknowledging not all users need to manipulate the data. 
The following should be considered (Connolly et al., 2014): 
Usability: Ensuring user friendliness for both technical and non-technical staff.
Performance and functionality: Automating tasks, filtering, forecasting and visualizing should be possible without performance issues. Integration with legacy spreadsheets is important.
Scalability: Growing user base should be considered.
Networking and shared access information: Supporting concurrent access for at least 5 analysts.
Security: Prioritizing secure storage of sensitive data. 
Backup and recovery: Implementing daily automatic backups.
Legal issues: System must adhere to legal regulations.
Visualization and reporting: Transforming data into insightful reports.
Cost: Cost should align with functionality.

Considering all the terms of references, Amazon RDS (Relationship Database Service) emerges as the prominent database management system. It stands out for its user-friendly interface, flexibility, scalability and cost-effectiveness, offering the advantage of “paying on demand” for utilized resources. Moreover, it facilitates easy access to legacy databases such as mySql or Oracle. Therefore users will have a chance to process the substantial data workloads in a single unified database.
</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>									


<p>The new database system aims to revolutionise customer interaction tracking and service improvement. Utilising best practices, it integrates data from various sources—National Rail feeds, legacy spreadsheets, and other organisational datasets—while addressing crucial aspects like usability, scalability, and security. The data management pipeline ensures accurate and efficient handling of the data, transforming disparate formats into a relational database. Opting for Amazon RDS as the database management system aligns with the company's needs for a user-friendly, scalable, and cost-effective solution. This comprehensive approach enables the company to enhance its customer service significantly and make data-driven decisions.</p>
