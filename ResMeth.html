<p style="text-align: justify;"><h3>Unit 1 - Ethics and AI Ethics: Key Concepts and Career Paths</h3></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
  <b>Ethics and How Ethics Work in AI</b>
</p>
<p>
  Ethics refers to principles that guide human behavior, determining what is right or wrong. In AI, ethics involves ensuring that AI technologies are developed and deployed in ways that align with fairness, transparency, and accountability (Deckard, 2023). This involves addressing issues such as privacy, bias, and the potential for harm.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <b>Correa et al. (2023) Overview</b>
</p>
<p>
  According to Correa et al. (2023), the field of AI ethics has seen significant growth, with numerous guidelines being created by governments, organizations, and academic institutions worldwide. However, there is a challenge in reaching a global consensus on the values that should guide AI development, given the diverse perspectives of different stakeholders. Their analysis of 200 governance policies highlights common principles like transparency, accountability, and fairness, but also notes significant regional differences and the need for better tools to compare these policies globally.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <b>Career Path in AI Ethics</b>
</p>
<p>
  Deckard (2023) emphasizes that a career in AI ethics requires a multidisciplinary approach, combining technical expertise with an understanding of ethical principles. Aspiring AI ethicists should focus on building a foundation in both technology and ethics, stay informed on AI developments, and engage in public policy discussions. Collaborating with professionals from various fields and developing practical solutions to real-world problems are essential skills for success in this area.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <b>Recommended Actions and Impact</b>
</p>
<p>
Given the rapidly evolving landscape of AI ethics, professionals should advocate for global standards that balance both short-term risks (like privacy breaches and bias) and long-term challenges (such as AI autonomy). Participating in shaping public policies and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations can help address the ethical concerns raised by AI. This proactive approach will ensure that AI technologies serve the public interest while mitigating potential legal, social, and professional challenges.
In conclusion, the growing demand for AI ethics highlights the importance of developing a career that integrates ethical thinking with technical expertise. With ongoing efforts to create governance frameworks, aspiring AI ethicists can play a vital role in shaping the future of AI in a way that aligns with global ethical standards

<p style="text-align: justify;"><h3>Unit 2</h3></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> During Unit 2, I focused on developing my research proposal, titled "The Impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Finance." I began by clearly defining my research question to guide the scope of the project. From the methods explored in this unit's readings, I found that a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative analysis, would be well-suited for examining the multifaceted impact of LLMs on financial practices. For data collection, I am considering surveys, case studies, and possibly secondary data analysis from financial reports and industry studies. This unit has helped me lay a solid foundation for my research and identify the necessary steps for moving forward.
</p>

									
<p style="text-align: justify;"><h3>Unit 2 - ePortfolio Assignment</h3></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Chosen case study from Acm: Automated Active Response Weaponry</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/using-the-code/case-automated-active-response-weaponry/ </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The case of "Automated Active Response Weaponry" raises significant ethical, legal, and social concerns in line with the BCS Code of Conduct.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <b>Legal and Jurisdictional Impact</b>
</p>
<p>
Q Industries' development of lethal automated responses breaches Principle 1.2, which prioritizes public safety. The secret meetings with governments suggest a potential violation of international human rights laws, including privacy and use-of-force regulations. Facial recognition technology, if misused, can conflict with privacy laws like GDPR, raising both jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional concerns.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <b>Social Impact</b>
</p>
<p>
Q’s use of facial recognition and non-lethal weapons in protests infringes on human rights, including privacy and free assembly, violating Principle 1.1. Moving towards lethal responses exacerbates these risks. The company also risks enabling discrimination, violating Principle 1.4 by working with governments that may use the technology oppressively.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <b>Professionalism</b>
</p>
<p>
Q’s engineers, adhering to Principle 2.5, resigned in protest over these ethical concerns, aligning with Principle 1.7 by planning to speak out. Q’s lawsuit against them for breaching confidentiality, though legally justifiable, undermines Principle 4.1, which emphasizes upholding the profession’s reputation and the public good.
</p>

<p>In summary, Q Industries failed to uphold key principles of the BCS Code of Conduct regarding public interest, legal compliance, and professional integrity. 
</p>
									

									
									
<p style="text-align: justify;"><h3>Unit 3</h3></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Unit 3, I learned about key aspects of research design and the importance of selecting the right approach based on the research objective. I was introduced to two main types of research design:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exploratory Research, which is used to explore specific aspects of a research area when the problem is not clearly defined. This type of research helps gain a better understanding of a situation or issue, though it does not provide conclusive results. An example of exploratory research is investigating the effectiveness of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) in mobile marketing.</li>
  
  <li>Conclusive Research, which focuses on verifying insights and supporting decision-making. A key category within this type is Descriptive Research, where the goal is to describe causes or factors in a specific area. For example, analyzing the effectiveness of social media as a marketing tool is a form of descriptive research.</li>

</ul>

<p></p>								
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also gained an understanding of how interviews and surveys can be integrated into research to gather data, and I learned how pre- and post-testing can be applied to measure changes or impacts in a study. This unit provided a strong foundation for understanding different research methods and how to choose the right one for my investigation. </p>


									
<p style="text-align: justify;"><h3>Unit 4</h3></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Unit 4, I was introduced to various data collection methods commonly used in qualitative research, though they can also be applied in quantitative research depending on the study's needs. By the end of this unit, I gained the ability to understand how to effectively use these methods and determine which would be suitable for my investigation based on the type of data needed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The key methods covered include:</p>


<ul>
  <li>Case Studies: These involve detailed research of individuals or groups to develop hypotheses and broaden the scope for studying a phenomenon. While useful for generating insights, case studies are not ideal for determining cause and effect due to potential biases and the risk of weak generalizations if atypical respondents are involved.</li>
  <li>Focus Groups: This method involves gathering a group of 6-10 people with common backgrounds to discuss and provide insights on a specific topic. Focus groups are valuable for answering "why," "what," and "how" questions, but careful selection of participants is crucial to ensure the data is relevant and reliable.</li>
  <li>Quantitative Observation: In this method, numerical data such as weight, volume, or other measurable values are collected from a sample. This objective data is then analyzed statistically to derive conclusions. Surveys and experiments are commonly used in this approach.</li>
  <li>Qualitative Observation: This involves observing characteristics and behaviors from a distance, allowing the researcher to monitor respondents in their natural environment. It provides deeper insights, such as tracking customer purchasing habits in a supermarket. The researcher can choose different levels of involvement, from being a passive observer to an active participant.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> This unit helped me understand how to apply these methods and decide which would best fit the goals of my research, considering the type of data I aim to collect.
</p>
										

									
<p style="text-align: justify;"><h3>Unit 5</h3></p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">The Cambridge Analytica scandal (2018) is one of the most infamous examples of the misuse of data collected through innocuous surveys. Cambridge Analytica obtained data from millions of Facebook users via a personality quiz app, exploiting Facebook's API, which allowed access to not only the quiz-takers’ data but also their friends' data. This information was used for political profiling and targeted advertising, influencing elections in the UK and USA without users' explicit consent (Confessore, 2018). The incident raised major ethical and legal concerns regarding data privacy and manipulation of personal information for political gains.</p>								

<p style="text-align: justify;">Further Examples of Inappropriate Survey Usage </p>									
									
<ul>
  <li>Google Location Tracking (2018): Google was found to collect users' location data even when users had disabled location tracking. This was done through apps and surveys embedded in Google services, raising concerns about transparency and consent. The data was primarily used for advertising, revealing an abuse of user trust (Fox, 2018).</li>
  <li>Equifax Data Breach (2017): Although not survey-based, Equifax's breach exposed the data of over 147 million individuals due to inadequate security protocols. This case highlighted the risks of storing large volumes of personal data without proper protection, which was later used for identity theft and fraud (Krebs, 2017).</li>
</ul>									

<b>Ethical, Social, Legal, and Professional Implications</b>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These examples demonstrate clear ethical violations related to privacy and transparency. Users were not fully informed of how their data would be used, breaching consent and autonomy principles. The social impact is significant, eroding public trust in technology platforms, while contributing to political manipulation and data misuse. Legally, these cases resulted in fines and stricter data protection laws like the GDPR, emphasizing the need for regulatory oversight. From a professional standpoint, these incidents underscore the responsibility of computing professionals to prioritize user privacy, adhere to ethical data handling practices, and uphold public trust.</p>									


									
									
									
									
									
									
<p style="text-align: justify;"><h3>Unit 6</h3></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In this unit, I was introduced to quantitative methods, which focus on examining the relationships between variables that are measured numerically and analyzed through statistical and graphical techniques. Quantitative research is often used to test hypotheses, measure outcomes, and make predictions, and it involves organizing data into datasets where variables are analyzed through various methods. </p>
									
<p style="text-align: justify;">A key focus of the unit was on descriptive statistics, which help summarize and make sense of data in a meaningful way. This includes graphical summaries to visually represent data, and two important summary measures: measures of location and measures of dispersion. Measures of location, such as the mean or median, help to identify a typical observation in the dataset, while measures of dispersion, like range or standard deviation, provide insight into the variability or spread of the data.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, I learned about the different levels of measurement for variables, which is essential for choosing the correct statistical methods. By understanding these concepts, I now have the ability to apply descriptive statistics, identify levels of measurement, and calculate measures of location and spread for a given dataset, helping to extract valuable insights from quantitative data.
 </p>

								
<p style="text-align: justify;"><h3>Unit 7 - Discussion Topic</h3></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Abi's consideration to analyze the correct data in a way that supports different conclusions is ethically questionable if it involves selectively emphasizing positive results while downplaying negative ones; he has an obligation to present all significant findings to maintain honesty and integrity. Although he isn't responsible for how others use his results, he must ensure his analyses are accurate and transparent. If he suspects the manufacturer will only publicize positive outcomes, he can document all findings comprehensively, advise the manufacturer on the importance of full disclosure, or consider publishing the results independently. Neglecting to act ethically could lead to legal issues, harm public trust, and damage his professional reputation due to the potential social, legal, and professional impacts of suppressing unfavorable data.
</p>

</p>

									
<b>Exercise 6.1 - Dietary data for weight loss </b>									
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Based on the results, Diet A has a mean weight loss of 5.341 with a standard deviation of 2.536, while Diet B shows a mean weight loss of 3.710 with a standard deviation of 2.769. These findings suggest that Diet A is more effective in reducing weight, as it results in a higher average weight loss compared to Diet B. Additionally, the slightly higher standard deviation for Diet B indicates more variability in the weight loss results for that diet. Overall, Diet A not only produces greater weight loss on average but also appears to offer more consistent results. However, further statistical analysis would be necessary to determine whether the observed differences are statistically significant.

</table>
<br>									
<ul>
  <li>Median Weight Loss: The median for Diet A (5.642) is higher than that of Diet B (3.745). The median provides a measure of central tendency that is less influenced by outliers, further supporting that Diet A tends to produce greater weight loss.</li>
  <li>Interquartile Range (IQR): The IQR for Diet A (3.285) is slightly lower than that for Diet B (3.451), indicating that the middle 50% of the data for Diet A shows less variability compared to Diet B. This aligns with the conclusion that Diet A delivers more consistent results.</li>
  <li>Weight Loss Distribution: The first quartile (Q1) for Diet A is 3.748 and for Diet B is 1.953, meaning that even the participants in the lower range of weight loss in Diet A lost more weight than those in Diet B. Additionally, the third quartile (Q3) for Diet A is 7.033 compared to 5.404 for Diet B, showing that those who achieved better results in Diet A tended to lose significantly more weight than those in Diet B.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Diet A appears to be more effective than Diet B in reducing weight, both in terms of higher average weight loss and more consistent results. The higher mean, median, and relatively lower variability for Diet A suggest it may provide better and more predictable weight loss outcomes than Diet B. However, a more in-depth statistical analysis would be necessary to confirm the significance of these differences.</p>

									
<b>Exercise 6.3 </b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The analysis of brand preferences between the two demographic areas reveals distinct patterns. In Area 1, a majority (60%) prefer brands other than A or B, showing a more diverse range of choices. In contrast, Area 2 shows stronger preferences for the main brands, with 21% preferring Brand A and 33% preferring Brand B, compared to 15.7% and 24.3% in Area 1, respectively. This suggests that Area 1 consumers have more varied brand preferences, while Area 2 consumers gravitate more towards the dominant brands, A and B. These findings indicate that marketing strategies should be tailored accordingly to the preferences of each area. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The paired t-test comparing the effectiveness of two filter agents shows that Agent 1 has a lower mean impurity level (8.25 parts per 1000) than Agent 2 (8.68 parts per 1000). The strong Pearson correlation (0.901) indicates a consistent relationship between the impurity levels of both agents across batches. The one-tailed t-test resulted in a t-statistic of -3.264 and a p-value of 0.0038, which is below the significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that Agent 1 is significantly more effective than Agent 2 in reducing impurities. </p>
