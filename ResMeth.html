<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Unit 1 - Ethics and AI Ethics: Key Concepts and Career Paths</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
<b>Ethics and How Ethics Work in AI </b>
<p>Ethics refers to principles that guide human behavior, determining what is right or wrong. In AI, ethics involves ensuring that AI technologies are developed and deployed in ways that align with fairness, transparency, and accountability (Deckard, 2023). This involves addressing issues such as privacy, bias, and the potential for harm.</p>

<b>Correa et al. (2023) Overview</b>
<p>  According to Correa et al. (2023), the field of AI ethics has seen significant growth, with numerous guidelines being created by governments, organizations, and academic institutions worldwide. However, there is a challenge in reaching a global consensus on the values that should guide AI development, given the diverse perspectives of different stakeholders. Their analysis of 200 governance policies highlights common principles like transparency, accountability, and fairness, but also notes significant regional differences and the need for better tools to compare these policies globally 
</p>
Career Path in AI Ethics Deckard (2023) emphasizes that a career in AI ethics requires a multidisciplinary approach, combining technical expertise with an understanding of ethical principles. Aspiring AI ethicists should focus on building a foundation in both technology and ethics, stay informed on AI developments, and engage in public policy discussions. Collaborating with professionals from various fields and developing practical solutions to real-world problems are essential skills for success in this area.

Recommended Actions and Impact Given the rapidly evolving landscape of AI ethics, professionals should advocate for global standards that balance both short-term risks (like privacy breaches and bias) and long-term challenges (such as AI autonomy). Participating in shaping public policies and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations can help address the ethical concerns raised by AI. This proactive approach will ensure that AI technologies serve the public interest while mitigating potential legal, social, and professional challenges.
In conclusion, the growing demand for AI ethics highlights the importance of developing a career that integrates ethical thinking with technical expertise. With ongoing efforts to create governance frameworks, aspiring AI ethicists can play a vital role in shaping the future of AI in a way that aligns with global ethical standards </p>


						
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Unit 2</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> During Unit 2, I focused on developing my research proposal, titled "The Impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Finance." I began by clearly defining my research question to guide the scope of the project. From the methods explored in this unit's readings, I found that a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative analysis, would be well-suited for examining the multifaceted impact of LLMs on financial practices. For data collection, I am considering surveys, case studies, and possibly secondary data analysis from financial reports and industry studies. This unit has helped me lay a solid foundation for my research and identify the necessary steps for moving forward.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Unit 2 - ePortfolio Assignment</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Chosen case study from Acm: Automated Active Response Weaponry
https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/using-the-code/case-automated-active-response-weaponry/

The case of "Automated Active Response Weaponry" raises significant ethical, legal, and social concerns in line with the BCS Code of Conduct.

Legal and Jurisdictional Impact:
Q Industries' development of lethal automated responses breaches Principle 1.2, which prioritizes public safety. The secret meetings with governments suggest a potential violation of international human rights laws, including privacy and use-of-force regulations. Facial recognition technology, if misused, can conflict with privacy laws like GDPR, raising both jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional concerns.

Social Impact:
Q’s use of facial recognition and non-lethal weapons in protests infringes on human rights, including privacy and free assembly, violating Principle 1.1. Moving towards lethal responses exacerbates these risks. The company also risks enabling discrimination, violating Principle 1.4 by working with governments that may use the technology oppressively.

Professionalism:
Q’s engineers, adhering to Principle 2.5, resigned in protest over these ethical concerns, aligning with Principle 1.7 by planning to speak out. Q’s lawsuit against them for breaching confidentiality, though legally justifiable, undermines Principle 4.1, which emphasizes upholding the profession’s reputation and the public good.
In summary, Q Industries failed to uphold key principles of the BCS Code of Conduct regarding public interest, legal compliance, and professional integrity.  </p>
