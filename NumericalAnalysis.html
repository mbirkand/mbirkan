    <h1>Numerical Analysis End of Module Assignment</h1>

    <p>The consumption of alcohol carries various health risks such as increased chances of accidents and injuries, as well as serious conditions like cancer and heart disease, which can lead to a decrease in life expectancy. <a href="#ref1">[1]</a></p>
    <p>Alcohol consumption and its associated impacts have long been a subject of concern in the United Kingdom. In 2019/20, an estimated 280,000 hospital admissions were primarily due to alcohol-related issues. This is 2% higher than 2018/19 and 8% higher than 2016/17. <a href="#ref2">[2]</a></p>
    <p>The annual cost to the NHS from alcohol misuse has been estimated as Â£2.7 billion at 2007 prices. <a href="#ref3">[3]</a></p>

    <h2>Purpose of this presentation</h2>

    <p>The purpose of this presentation is to assess the alcohol situation in the UK.</p>
    <p>Data used for that reason is a Health Survey from 2011, which is a survey designed to monitor trends in the nation's health. The survey is also used to monitor progress towards selected health targets.</p>
    <p>Statistical analysis will be calculated using R, as R can perform complex statistical computations easily.</p>

    <h2>Significance test to find out which gender drinks more alcohol</h2>

    <p>Total in the sample: 10617</p>
    <p>Total answered to the drinking status question yes or no: 8534 people</p>
    <p>There is a statistically significant difference in alcohol consumption between males and females, with males being more likely to drink alcohol than females. </p>
    <p>The extremely small P-value indicates that this result is highly unlikely to have occurred by chance, meaning that the difference in alcohol consumption rates between genders is statistically significant.</p>
    <p>Given the context of the contingency table, where a higher percentage of males (83.9%) drink alcohol compared to females (74.4%), the Chi-squared test supports the conclusion that gender is associated with alcohol consumption, and that this association is strong and statistically significant.</p>

    <h2>Significance test to find out which region drinks more alcohol</h2>

    <p>High Chi-squared statistic and the p-value being less than 2.2e-16, it can be concluded with a high degree of confidence that there is a significant association between the region and drinking status.</p>
    <p>P-value < 2.2e-16: This extremely small p-value indicates that the probability of observing a Chi-squared statistic as extreme as 98.53 under the null hypothesis (which states there is no association between region and drinking status) is virtually zero. This leads to reject the null hypothesis and conclude there is a statistically significant association between region and drinking status.</p>
    <p>According to the provided table, the South-West region has the highest proportion of drinkers at 83.9%. The East Midlands follows closely with a ratio of 82.1%, while both the South-East and the East of England regions are tied for the third-highest ratio at 81.6%. London registers the smallest percentage of drinkers relative to the other regions.</p>

    <h2>Investigate whether there is a statistical difference between men and women on Valid height</h2>

    <p>To compare different groups; Two Sample (Welch) t-test is appropriate.</p>
    <p>H0: There is no connection between sex and height.</p>
    <p>H1: There is connection between sex and height.</p>
    <p>Results:</p>
    <p>t = 25.197, df = 6964.1, p-value < 2.2e-16</p>
